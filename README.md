CitiCare: Barangay Gumamela Healthcare Monitoring System
System Description
CitiCare: Barangay Gumamela Healthcare Monitoring System is a web-based healthcare information management system designed to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of healthcare service delivery within Barangay Gumamela. The system facilitates the centralized management of resident health records, enabling Barangay Health Workers (BHWs) to monitor health conditions, track patient information, and support evidence-based decision-making.

A key component of the system is its AI-powered recommendation functionality, which analyzes resident health data to identify priority cases, detect emerging disease trends, classify residents and puroks according to health-related indicators, and forecast medicine demand. By transforming healthcare data into actionable insights, the system supports proactive healthcare planning, resource allocation, and community health interventions.

Main Features
The CitiCare system provides the following core functionalities:

Resident Classification and Prioritization – Categorizes residents based on health-related factors to assist healthcare workers in identifying priority cases and allocating resources effectively.
Data Analytics and Health Monitoring – Analyzes collected health data to identify trends, patterns, and potential health risks within the community.
Report Generation – Generates comprehensive reports to support monitoring, evaluation, and decision-making processes for healthcare programs and services.
System Architecture and Technologies
The system is developed using modern web technologies to ensure scalability, maintainability, and performance.

System Development Methodology
This study adopts the Agile Development Methodology, specifically the Scrum Framework, to guide the design and development of the CitiCare Healthcare Monitoring System. Agile is selected due to its iterative development approach, emphasis on stakeholder collaboration, and ability to accommodate evolving system requirements throughout the development lifecycle.

The development process consists of six phases:

Planning Phase – Requirements are gathered and analyzed through consultations with Barangay Health Workers (BHWs) to identify functional and non-functional system requirements.
Design Phase – The system architecture, database structure, user interface, and overall system design are developed based on the identified requirements.
Development Phase – System functionalities are incrementally implemented through Agile sprints, allowing continuous refinement and validation of features.
Testing Phase – Functional, integration, and user acceptance testing are conducted to ensure system reliability, accuracy, and usability.
Deployment Phase – The completed system is deployed within the operational environment of Barangay Gumamela and prepared for end-user utilization.
Review Phase – System performance and effectiveness are evaluated through stakeholder feedback, providing a basis for future enhancements and continuous improvement.
Throughout the development process, Barangay Health Workers actively participate in requirements validation, feature evaluation, and system testing to ensure that the final product accurately reflects the healthcare workflows and operational needs of the barangay.

Project Setup
1. Database Setup (Supabase)
The application uses Supabase as its backend database and authentication provider.

Step 1: Create a Supabase Project
Sign in to the Supabase Dashboard.
Click New Project.
Enter your project details and wait for the project to finish provisioning.
Step 2: Retrieve API Credentials
Navigate to: Settings → API Copy the following values:

Project URL
Anon (Public) Key
Service Role Key These credentials will be used by the frontend and backend.
Step 3: Initialize the Database Schema
Open the SQL Editor.
Create a new query.
Paste the project's SQL schema.
Click Run to create the required tables, indexes, and relationships.
Step 4: Configure Row Level Security (RLS)
After the tables have been created:

Enable Row Level Security (RLS) on all tables.

## Step 1: Navigate to the Backend Directory
```bash
cd citicare-backend
```
---
## Step 2: Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```
---
## Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

```bash
touch .env
```
Add the following environment variables:
```env
PORT=5000
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
SUPABASE_KEY=your_supabase_service_role_key
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=your_deepseek_api_key
```
---
## Step 4: Start the Backend Server
Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```
Or run the production server:
```bash
npm start
```
The backend server will be available at:
